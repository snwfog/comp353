# Wiz. Trade

> This project was part of a 4 credit database course at Concordia University. We had approximately 3 weeks of time to implements a almost full featured item trading system _from scratch_. In addition, a lot of problems arised because of the cheap server that the school provided to us further complicated the deployment of the project. We couldn't use a framework because the school admin disabled htaccess on the Apache server. Thus we had to write a framework from the ground up that would act like a MVC structure without htaccess redirect.
